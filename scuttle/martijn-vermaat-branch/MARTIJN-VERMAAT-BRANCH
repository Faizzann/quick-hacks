This branch from Scuttle 0.7.2 contains some changes for personal use and some
changes to make it all work on Dreamhost.

* Clean URLs and PHP5 CGI
  M      functions.inc.php
  M      .htaccess
  M      api/.htaccess

  We want to use PHP5, but there is a bug in the clean URL handling in the
  PHP5 version used on Dreamhost. Adding the MultiViews option to Apache and
  making sure URLs don't end with a slash makes things work.

  However, for the del.icio.us API, we need to run the PHP4 Apache module,
  because that's the only way to use HTTP Basic Authentication.


* Disable user registration
  M      templates/toolbar.inc.php
  M      api/.htaccess
  M      register.php


* Configuration for my Dreamhost setup
  A  +   config.inc.php.dreamhost


* No debugging mode
  M      debug.inc.php


* Branch information and upstream reference
  A  +   MARTIJN-VERMAAT-BRANCH
  M      templates/about.tpl.php


* Use Scuttle with Epilicious

  lines in /usr/lib/epiphany/2.18/extensions/libepilicious/delicious.py:
