This is a small hack to query the Tentamen Inschrijvings Systeem Vrije
Universiteit from the command line. It shows your results for all
courses contained in the TISVU system.

It needs your VU-net-id username and password.

The script depends on the PBP web tool for Python, available from:
  http://pbp.berlios.de/


Since it parses the HTML output of TISVU, the script will break easily
if anything is changed in the TISVU application. Considering the history
of the IT departement at the VU, we can safely assume nothing will
change here for at least a few years ;)
